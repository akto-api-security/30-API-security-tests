# How to Create an Automated API Inventory using Traffic Mirroring in Akto

üìù This README provides a step-by-step guide on how to set up an automated API inventory using traffic mirroring in Akto. This allows you to capture network traffic and extract API endpoints for analysis and documentation purposes.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following:

- An Akto account with appropriate permissions.
- Access to the network infrastructure to configure traffic mirroring.
- A system or tool to capture and process network traffic (e.g., Wireshark, tcpdump).

## Step 1: Set Up Traffic Mirroring

1. üîí Log in to your Akto account and navigate to the management console.
2. Identify the network infrastructure component (e.g., switch, router) responsible for forwarding traffic to the API server.
3. Configure traffic mirroring on the network infrastructure component to replicate inbound and/or outbound traffic to a designated destination port. Consult your network infrastructure documentation for specific instructions.
4. Choose a system or tool (e.g., a dedicated server, virtual machine) where you will capture and process the mirrored traffic. Connect this system to the designated destination port using an Ethernet cable.

## Step 2: Capture and Process Traffic

1. On the system where you'll capture traffic, install and configure your chosen tool (e.g., Wireshark, tcpdump) to listen on the designated destination port. Follow the installation instructions provided by the tool's documentation.
2. Start capturing network traffic using the configured tool. For example, in Wireshark, select the network interface connected to the destination port and click the "Start" button to begin capturing traffic.
3. Generate traffic by interacting with the API server or running existing tests, ensuring a variety of API endpoints are exercised. This could involve making API requests using a tool like cURL or Postman, or running test scripts.
4. Allow the tool to capture network traffic for a sufficient duration to gather an adequate sample of API interactions. It is recommended to capture traffic during a representative usage period to ensure a comprehensive inventory.
5. Stop capturing network traffic once you have enough data to work with. In Wireshark, click the "Stop" button to end the capture.
6. Export the captured traffic data into a suitable format (e.g., PCAP, HAR) for further analysis. Most capture tools provide options to save the captured data as a file. Choose the appropriate format and save the file to a location for later use.

## Step 3: Extract API Endpoints

1. Analyze the captured traffic data using a suitable tool or script to extract the API endpoints accessed during the captured interactions. This can be done using tools like Wireshark, tcpdump, or custom scripts.
2. Consider applying filters or rules to exclude non-API traffic and focus only on relevant HTTP or HTTPS requests. This helps eliminate noise and extract only the API-related requests. Consult the documentation of your chosen tool for instructions on applying filters.
3. Extract relevant information from each captured request, such as the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.), URL path, query parameters, and request headers. This can be done manually by reviewing the captured data or using scripts to automate the extraction process.
4. Store the extracted API endpoint data in a structured format (e.g., JSON, CSV) for further processing. You can create a file or database to store the extracted information for later use in the automation process.

## Step 4: Automate the Process

1. Develop a script or application that automates the process of capturing traffic, extracting API endpoints, and storing the data. This can be done using a programming language of your choice. You can use libraries or APIs provided by your chosen language to interact with the capture tools and process the data.
2. Configure the script or application to run periodically or trigger it manually whenever you need to update the API inventory. Consider using scheduling tools or integrating the script with other automation frameworks to run it at regular intervals or in response to specific events.
3. Consider integrating the script or application with other tools or systems to facilitate further processing, documentation, or reporting. For example, you can integrate it with documentation platforms like Swagger or Postman to automatically update API documentation based on the captured inventory.
4. Test the automation process to ensure it functions as expected and captures all relevant API endpoints accurately. Perform thorough testing to verify that the script or application captures and processes the traffic correctly, and the API inventory is updated as expected.

## Conclusion

üéâ Following the steps outlined in this guide, you can create an automated API inventory using traffic mirroring in Akto. By capturing and extracting API endpoints, you can gain insights into your API landscape and maintain an up-to-date inventory for analysis and documentation purposes.

üìö Remember to consult the specific documentation of your chosen tools and technologies for detailed instructions and best practices.

Happy API inventory creation! üöÄ
